# Nextcloud Cookbook Client

The Nextcloud Cookbook Client is an iOS/iPadOS/MacOS client application for the Nextcloud service 'Nextcloud CookBook'.
It is your personal recipe organizer. You can currently view and download your recipes, but more features are planned.

# Privacy Information
This application does not collect any data. The recipes downloaded from your Nextcloud server never leave your device. Since it is open-source, this is easily verifyable on the [project's github page](https://github.com/VincentMeilinger/Nextcloud-Cookbook-iOS).
